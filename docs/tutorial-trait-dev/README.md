# Tutorial: Trait development

Fork the glitch.com project below to get started, and follow the instructions on its README.md

https://glitch.com/~intergalactic-sdk-playground

Once you have developed your trait, send a PR in [this repository](https://github.com/desolatenft/intergalactic-sdk):

1. Add your trait to the `traits` folder
2. Be sure to have theauthor match your Github author, the folder name match the trait name, and the version match the version of your trait. If you're unsure which version to use, use 1.0.0
3. At this time, only JS traits with aframe-1.3.0 as a targetare supported. More will be added in the future.
4. When sending the PR, if possible send a linnk to a glitch.com project that showcases your trait. If not, add a screenshot of your trait in action.
5. Await a few days for the PR to be merged. Once it is, your trait will be available for anyone to use!
